# Testing

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are inline next to the component under test in `src`.

## High-level Tests

This directory contains more holistic tests.

### Standards

The standards test confirms agreement between `simple-cesr`'s output and other implementations of CESR. Currently, it checks against the output from `matter` in [signify-ts](https://github.com/weboftrust/signify-ts) from [WebOfTrust](https://github.com/weboftrust).
