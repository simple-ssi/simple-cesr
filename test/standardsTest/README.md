# Standards Test

The standards test confirms agreement of `simple-cesr`'s output with other implementations of CESR.

The examples in `standards.ts` are from the `Matter` class in [cesr-ts](https://github.com/weboftrust/cesr-ts) (derived from [signify-ts](https://github.com/weboftrust/signify-ts)) from [WebOfTrust](https://github.com/weboftrust). Given the same given inputs, `simple-cesr` should produce the same given outputs as `Matter`.
