# Instructions

- Run `npm install` to get the required packages.
- There's a basic .gitignore provided, you'll need to run `git init`, however.
- The `dist` directory is meant to be the build folder for TypeScript. The line is commented out in `tsconfig.json`, however.
- You should have the 'StandardJS' and 'Jest' extensions installed in VSCode and enabled in this workspace
